How do we make Apache Ignite nodes discover each other? 

Apache Ignite has an IpFinder component, which handles registration and discovery of nodes. 
For specific information, refer to Apache Ignite docs.

TcpDiscoveryMulticastIpFinder uses Multicast to discover other nodes in the grid and is the default IP finder. 
You should not have to specify it unless you plan to override default settings. 
Here is an example of how to configure this finder via a Spring XML file or programmatically from Java:

Multicast IP Finder :



TcpDiscoverySpi spi = new TcpDiscoverySpi();
 
TcpDiscoveryMulticastIpFinder ipFinder = new TcpDiscoveryMulticastIpFinder();
 
ipFinder.setMulticastGroup("228.10.10.157");
 
spi.setIpFinder(ipFinder);
 
IgniteConfiguration cfg = new IgniteConfiguration();
 
// Override default discovery SPI.
cfg.setDiscoverySpi(spi);
 
// Start Ignite node.
Ignition.start(cfg);



Static IP Finder :

For cases when Multicast is disabled, TcpDiscoveryVmIpFinder should be used with pre-configured list of IP addresses.

You are only required to provide at least one IP address of a remote node,
 but usually it is advisable to provide 2 or 3 addresses of grid nodes that you plan to start at some point of time in the future. 
Once a connection to any of the provided IP addresses is established, Ignite will automatically discover all other grid nodes.
